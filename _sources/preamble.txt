Installation and dependencies
=============================


You will need IPython 0.11, and pyzmq >= 2.1.4. If you have EPD 7.1, you have both of these, but
IPython is 0.11.rc1. rc1 is mostly fine, with a few little bugs, but the main difference
you will notice is that in rc1, specifying values on the command-line does not expect
a leading ``--``.

In rc1::

    ipython profile=foo --pylab

It turns out, people hate this, so in dev and the future, this is::

    ipython --profile=foo --pylab

This pattern is true for all cl *assignments* (non-assignment flags did not change).

IPython from master::

    git clone git://github.com/ipython/ipython.git

or without git::

    pip install https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tarball/master

pyzmq-2.1.7 has eggs for various current OSX and Windows Pythons. If we don't have an egg
for you, you can build & install libzmq from http://www.zeromq.org/area:download.

After you have libzmq (and run ldconfig to update its cache), pyzmq is
pip/easy_installable.
